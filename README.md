An application that converts text to sql. The front end is made using react and tailwind while the backend is completely written in python. We used the help of qwen-32B model to convert the text to SQL. This project was initially built for a Speakspace hackathon with the help of **[@anadhikag](https://github.com/anadhikag)**, **[@AnnaIsson](https://github.com/AnnaIsson)** and **[@joel-dsilva](https://github.com/joel-dsilva)** and we decided to make a frontend for it as it would help us out in Data Base Management Systems. You can access the website [here](https://texttosql.pages.dev/).
